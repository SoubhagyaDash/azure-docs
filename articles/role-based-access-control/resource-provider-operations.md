# Azure Resource Manager Resource Provider operations

This document lists the operations available for each Microsoft Azure Resource Manager resource provider. These can be used in custom roles to provide granular Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) permissions to resources in Azure. Please note this is not a comprehensive list and operations may be added or removed as each provider is updated. Operation strings follow the format of `Microsoft.<ProviderName>/<ChildResourceType>/<action>`. 

> [!NOTE]
> For a comprehensive and current list please use `Get-AzureRmProviderOperation` (in PowerShell) or `az provider operation list` (in Azure CLI v2) to list operations of Azure resource providers.
